In this work, we propose a novel framework called High-order Autoencoder based Collaborative Filtering (HACF) that enhances the classic
NeuMF framework with autoencoders for capturing latent high-order connectivity signals in the useritem
interaction graph. Specifically, each user-item pair is augmented with higher-order neighbours
and input to two sets of autoencoders, one set for the users and the other for the items. All the autoencoders
in one set share parameters so increasing the number of autoencoders does not increase
the model size.
We have conducted extensive experiments on four popular public benchmark datasets with different
sparsity. The overall comparison results demonstrate the advantages of autoencoder-based
methods and show that our framework outperforms some state-of-the-art DNN-based collaborative
filtering approaches.
